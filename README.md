## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

in this challenge, I've learned many things about javascript and form validations, the checkValidity() function is very helpful, and the "validity" property that has many properties as well.
On css i learn how to edit the "input type number" and override its default style



```css
input[type="number"] {
    -webkit-appearance: textfield !important;
    margin: 0;
    -moz-appearance: textfield !important;
}

```
